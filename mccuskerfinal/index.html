                            <p>Vaccines are an extremely important part of modern medicine and are used worldwide to save millions of lives each year. They can eradicate diseases, help prevent medical costs, and remain one of the most effective and powerful tools in public health for preventing infectious diseases.</p>

                            <p>Most vaccines are administered to children at a young age, in order to teach their developing immune systems to prevent highly infectious diseases. Childhood vaccination is also done to create herd immunity. This is when enough members of a community are vaccinated, it becomes difficult for the disease to spread, even to people who are not vaccinated. Childhood vaccination is proven to have many benefits, and according to data sourced in 2018 by Wellcome Trust, a UK-based healthcare research foundation, while there is some deviation between countries, most people across the world agree that vaccines are important for children to have. </p>

                        <p>Bangladesh, Egypt, and Rwanda are some of the countries that agree the most on the safety, effectiveness, and importance of vaccines. They have seen great success with high immunization rates. France, on the other hand, is notably skeptical of vaccines, with one in three French people believing that they are unsafe. The French government is working to combat this by requiring more vaccinations by law for children and running promotional campaigns. </p>
                        
                        <p>In recent years, public attitudes toward vaccines have evolved dramatically. The COVID-19 pandemic and the recent political landscape have shifted attitudes towards vaccines in the United States, as misinformation and pandemic fatigue have increased skepticism. According to a recent survey by the Pew Research Center, six in ten Americans said they will probably not get an updated 2024-25 COVID-19 vaccine. Additionally, the survey found that Republicans are more likely to opt themselves and their children out of vaccines, such as Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) and COVID-19 boosters.</p>

                    <p>Madeleine Bartzak, who manages Infection Prevention and Control at Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Newton, Massachusetts, saw hesitancy grow during the pandemic and the following years.</p>

                       <p>“COVID-19 was a very interesting time for vaccine hesitancy. In 2021, after the vaccine was widely available, COVID-19 deaths dropped off, but continued at high rates in patients who refused vaccination. From that perspective it was difficult for me to understand the hesitancy,” Bartzak said. </p>
                    
                    <p>Bartzak said that while vaccines are proven to be safe and effective, the skepticism around them has still grown.</p>

                    <p>“The data to support the effectiveness of vaccines approved by the FDA is clear, in part due to the rigorous process in place to ensure both the safety and efficacy of vaccines before offering them to the general public. But, the safety of vaccines was undermined by a now-discounted researcher in 1998 when he published a paper erroneously hypothesizing that the MMR vaccine caused autism,” Bartzak said. </p>

                        <br/>
                        <p>Even though this study was flawed and later studies reaffirmed that a link between the MMR vaccine and autism did not exist, the idea that vaccines could cause more harm than good had been released into the national and global psyche and has grown since. This is largely due to misinformation on social media, where doctors' and scientists' voices are on equal footing with those of people who are not qualified sources on vaccinations.  </p>

                        As the data shows, the reality of this misinformation and trend in attitudes is that while many people have agreed that vaccines are effective, many more people also believe that they are unsafe. President-elect Donald Trump’s new pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services may exacerbate these attitudes. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has repeatedly made false claims and perpetuated myths about the effects of vaccinations, even claiming on a Fox News interview in 2023 that they do cause autism. He is even the founder of a prominent anti-vaccine activist group called Children’s Health Defense that has filed almost 30 state and federal lawsuits against vaccines and public health mandates.

                        Between the pandemic, the age of social media, and even misinformation from government officials, it is no wonder that we see a rise in anti-vaccine attitudes around the world and must find strategies to counter it. The National Institute of Health describes ways to combat this growing skepticism of vaccines. One way is community engagement. This can mean larger vaccination campaigns or more interpersonal connections. An example of this is recruiting trusted messengers like community and faith leaders as an important way to reach skeptical communities, as many communities are less trusting of the medical and scientific fields. Another option is using coercive techniques, like family assistance payments, tax benefits, and other rewards if an individual gets vaccinated. The data, trends, and attitudes in the United States and abroad indicate an increasing demand for these strategies in the years ahead.
